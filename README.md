# MetacraftersSolidity
This is the project for the Introduction to Solidity by MetaCrafters.

## Description
This project is written in .sol which showcases the basics of the language.

### Mint
This "mints" or creates tokens. It takes in address and value, and mints the tokens on the address, and adds to the total supply.
